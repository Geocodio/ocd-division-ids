OCD ID Types used in `country-in`:
*    state - represents the states in India
*    territory - represents the union territories of India
*    district - electoral districts delimited by the Election Commissions of India
*    special:graduate - electoral division only for graduates used 
*    special:teacher - electoral division only for teachers used 
*    special:local_authority - electoral division only for local authorities 
*    special:local_body - electoral division only for local bodies
*    high_court - represents the high court district

Local body vs Local Authority:
*    Only in the context of Vidhan Parishad / Legislative Council: local body and local authorities mean the same. However, since different states are using different terms, we are following the term used by the state in our ocd-ids for consistency.
